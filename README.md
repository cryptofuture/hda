hda 
================
###### Humanism Decentralization Anonimity
hda is ZCash fork based on currently stable Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 codebase. Original Zcash based on bitcoin 0.11.2.  
hda project aimed to be always be in sync with the latest stable Bitcoin Core version, while stay Zerocash protocol representation.  
However, at current state you can't build project and I hope to find enthusiasts, who willing to help make it run, and help with development.
There will not be any founders fees, slow starts and what so ever in this project. Any person could share idea, and suggest chain and starting parameters.  
I also want to make codebase as light as possible. Docs will be on GitHub Wiki in repository, no release notes in repository, and you don't need to read any code of conduct and share you real family name in pull requests.  
hda open to ideas, and people will be always first priority, then decentralization and last but not least transactions anonimity.  
In case, I didn't find someone to help with the project, repository will be open anyway, and you can't fork it on any state.  
Also, if we ever be launched, binary packages and repositories to popular OS should be ready before any launch, and I found it critical thing to do too.  
Fast launch is not the main priority there. There will be a test network, and packages should be tested, overall crazy work should to be done, before official launch. 
And yes, open repository on Christmas was not in initial plan... Wonderful Christmas everybody!
